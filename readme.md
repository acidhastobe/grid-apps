npm start

to start a local instance of the apps. then open
[Kiri:Moto](http://localhost:8080/kiri) or


### Other Start Options

```
npm run-script start-web
```
serves code as obfuscated, compressed bundles. this is the mode used to run on a public
web site, so you can't use "localhost" to test. to accommodate this, alias "debug" to 127.0.0.1
then access the apps from http://debug:8080/
